## PastaClub
A social media application for people within a community to meetup at a monthly meetup for a homemade meal.

## Motivation
The motivation for this application was to have a median where a community could get together on a monthly basis in order to meet new people, learn basic cooking skills, and have a sense of belonging. 
 
## Screenshots
